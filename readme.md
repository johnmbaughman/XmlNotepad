XML Notepad provides a simple intuitive User Interface for browsing and editing XML documents. There are two ways to install it:
1. [ClickOnceÂ® installer](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/xmlnotepad/readme.htm) - this is the most convenient, install it directly from the web browser.
2. [Standalone downloadable installer](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/xmlnotepad/xmlnotepadsetup.zip) if you need something that works offline.
Just download the zip file, copy it to the machine you want to install it on, unzip the file on that machine and run xmlnotepadsetup.msi.

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble installing the ClickOnce installer package, try a Microsoft Web Browser.  Chrome sometimes does the wrong thing.  Do not attempt to download
the setup.exe from http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/xmlnotepad/setup.exe.
ClickOnce only works when you "click" the link in the web browser.  This is actually a security feature.  ClickOnce is verifying the that package it is installing actually came from http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/xmlnotepad/setup.exe and no where else.  This ensures the package has not been tampered with.
